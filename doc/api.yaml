  title: The WASAPhoto Project
  description: |-
    The WASAPhoto Project uses an API that is developed having the following design in mind;

    Each user will have access to a stream of images (photos), in reverse chronological order.
    Each photo will contain information on the time of publishing (date and time) and the amount of likes and comments.
    The displayed photos will originate from other users the user in question follows.
    They can place likes, as well as remove them (on other users' photo(s)).
    They can comment, as well as remove their own (on any user's photo(s)).

    Similarly, users can ban other users, as well as retract the ban.
    A ban means the banner prevents the banned from seeing the banner's information.

    Users have profiles. A profile shows the stream of photos (in reverse), the amount of photos uploaded and
    the user's followers and following.
    Users can change usernames, upload photos (as well as remove them) and follow other users (as well as unfollow them).
    Photo removal also removes its likes and comments.

    Users can search another user's profile via their username.

    Logins are simplified, i.e., they occur just by specifying the user's username.
    From the official project description, 'If the username already exists, the user is logged in.
    If the username is new, the user is registered and logged in.
    The API will return the user identifier you need to pass into the Authorization header in any other API.'
    There won't be HTTP sessions or cookies.
